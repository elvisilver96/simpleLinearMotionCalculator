Linear  motion is  a basic  knowledge in static/dynamic matter.  Linear motion is a motion along straight line, and can be 
described   mathematically.  The  linear motion can be two types which is uniform linear motion with  constant velocity or
zero acceleration and non uniform linear motion  with variable  velocity non zero acceleration  variable velocity/non zero 
velocity   acceleration. An  example  of linear motion is an athlete running 100m along a straight track.
